For students in the class, it is not easy to get all the information about the class in one place. If a student is absent, they need to ask their friends for notes. Sometimes, they cannot take notes or miss a class due to personal problems or events, and it becomes difficult for them to know the topics covered on a particular day. Also, students are not aware of their daily attendance. To overcome all these problems, we have developed a solution called 'Study Sync Website' to help students access and manage all their classroom information in one place. With Study Sync, students can easily view their class schedules, check the topics covered on a particular day, access subject-wise notes, and keep track of their attendance. With Study Sync, organizing and managing classroom information becomes easier. The website is applicable for a single section only.
